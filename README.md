# Password Generator

## Description
This project taught me to loop through JavaScript variables as well as manipulate some elements of the DOM. Functionally, the application allows the user to generate a random password by selecting a length and the types of characters they would like to include.

Through this project, I learned how to manipulate DOM elements via class selectors or IDs as well as how to do some slight animations using CSS transitions.

## Installation
This application does not require installation, but can be accessed anonymously at https://cleave13.github.io/password-generator/.

## Usage
This simple application has two primary steps:  

1. When you load the page, you will be presented with a text box with placeholder text and a primary call to action button.

2. When you click the "configure" button, you will expose a list of prompts that allow you to select a character length (using the slider) and configure which special characters you would like your password to include.

3. When you click generate, the app will return a password with the length and character types that the user configured.
